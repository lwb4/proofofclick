# Proof of Click

Proof of Click is a simple clicking game hosted entirely on the Solana blockchain. Play it now at [https://tungsten.games/proofofclick](https://tungsten.games/proofofclick).

There are no intermediary trusted servers, other than a static CDN needed to host the frontend. Every game interaction is a transaction on-chain.

Proof of Click will remain open-source forever. Since money is a core blockchain primitive and the value is in the network, I'm sure I can figure out some other way to make money as a dev on this project without selling the code itself.

This is a very early alpha build, and almost certainly has bugs! Please report them here or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/chalcidfly).

## Roadmap

Right now, all you can do is click a button to mint a token into your token. Planned features include:

- Swap click tokens for cursor tokens, which increases the number of tokens you get every time you click
- Deposit click tokens into a bank, and collect the later with interest

Ideas that I've considered but not fully thought through yet:
- Purchase and burn "power-up" NFTs to give you a temporary boost in clicks, bank interest, or anything else
- Achievement NFTs that you can show off and sell on OpenSea

Once the game is ready for mainnet, I will also register these tokens in the Solana Token Registry and create some swapping pools on Serum or some other DEX.
